# Data-Efficient Model Learning for Control with Jacobian-Regularized Dynamic Mode Decomposition

This contains the code used to generate the figures and examples in the CORL 2022 
paper.

## Running the Examples
To run the examples, run the `<xxx>_main.jl` files in the `examples/` folder, which are 
organized by system. Each file should activate the project environment and download all
required packages.

Note that the visualization code will probably not work, since the models used for the 
visuals in the paper were too lage to be included in the supplementary materials.
