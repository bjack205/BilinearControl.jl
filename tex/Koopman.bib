  abstract = {Planetary soft landing is one of the benchmark problems of optimal control theory and is gaining renewed interest due to the increased focus on the exploration of planets in the solar system, such as Mars. The soft landing problem with all relevant constraints can be posed as a finite-horizon optimal control problem with state and control constraints. The real-time generation of fuel-optimal paths to a prescribed location on a planet's surface is a challenging problem due to the constraints on the fuel, the control inputs, and the states. The main difficulty in solving this constrained problem is the existence of nonconvex constraints on the control input, which are due to a nonzero lower bound on the control input magnitude and a nonconvex constraint on its direction. This paper introduces a convexification of the control constraints that is proven to be lossless; i.e., an optimal solution of the soft landing problem can be obtained via solution of the proposed convex relaxation of the problem. The lossless convexification enables the use of interior point methods of convex optimization to obtain optimal solutions of the original nonconvex optimal control problem. \textcopyright{} 1993-2012 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Current linear-time simulation methods for articulated figures are based exclusively on reduced-coordinate formulations. This paper describes a general, non-iterative linear-time simulation method based instead on Lagrange multipliers. Lagrange multiplier methods are important for computer graphics applications because they bypass the difficult (and often intractable) problem of parameterizing a system's degrees of freedom. Given a loop-free set of n equality constraints acting between pairs of bodies, the method takes O(n) time to compute the system's dynamics. The method does not rely on matrix bandwidth, so no assumptions about the constraints' topology are needed. Bodies need not be rigid, constraints can be of various dimensions, and unlike reduced-coordinate approaches, nonholonomic (e.g. velocity-dependent) constraints are allowed. An additional set of k one-dimensional constraints which induce loops and/or handle inequalities can be accommodated with cost O(kn). This makes it practical to simulate complicated, closedloop articulated figures with joint-limits and contact at interactive rates. A complete description of a sample implementation is provided in pseudocode.},

This online joint velocity and ground reaction force optimization integrates a kinodynamic model of a wheeled quadrupedal robot. It defines the single rigid body dynamics along with the robot's kinematics while treating the wheels as moving ground contacts. With this approach, we can accurately capture the robot's rolling constraint and dynamics, enabling automatic discovery of hybrid maneuvers without needless motion heuristics. The formulation's generality through the simultaneous optimization over the robot's whole-body variables allows for a single set of parameters and makes online gait sequence adaptation possible. Aperiodic gait sequences are automatically found through kinematic leg utilities without the need for predefined contact and lift-off timings, reducing the cost of transport by up to 85 \%. Our experiments demonstrate dynamic motions on a quadrupedal robot with non-steerable wheels in challenging indoor and outdoor environments. The paper's findings contribute to evaluating a decomposed, i.e., sequential optimization of wheel and torso motion, and single-task motion planner with a novel quantity, the prediction error, which describes how well a receding horizon planner can predict the robot's future state. To this end, we report an improvement of up to 71 \% using our proposed single-task approach, making fast locomotion feasible and revealing wheeled-legged robots' full potential.}

The theoretical analysis is further leveraged to devise an accelerated implementation of \{GuSTO\}, which originally infuses ideas from indirect optimal control into an \{SCP\} context.

  abstract = {Many problems of recent interest in statistics and machine learning can be posed in the framework of convex optimization. Due to the explosion in size and complexity of modern datasets, it is increasingly important to be able to solve problems with a very large number of features or training examples. As a result, both the decentralized collection or storage of these datasets as well as accompanying distributed solution methods are either necessary or at least highly desirable. In this review, we argue that the alternating direction method of multipliers is well suited to distributed convex optimization, and in particular to large-scale problems arising in statistics, machine learning, and related areas. The method was developed in the 1970s, with roots in the 1950s, and is equivalent or closely related to many other algorithms, such as dual decomposition, the method of multipliers, Douglas-Rachford splitting, Spingarn's method of partial inverses, Dykstra's alternating projections, Bregman iterative algorithms for {$\mathscr{l}$}1 problems, proximal methods, and thers. After briefly surveying the theory and history of the algorithm, we discuss applications to a wide variety of statistical and machine learning problems of recent interest, including the lasso, sparse logistic regression, basis pursuit, covariance selection, support vector machines, and many others. We also discuss general distributed optimization, extensions to the nonconvex setting, and efficient implementation, including some details on distributed MPI and Hadoop MapReduce implementations. \textcopyright{} 2011 S.

  abstract = {Nonlinear dynamical systems can be made easier to control by lifting them into the space of observable functions, where their evolution is described by the linear Koopman operator. This letter describes how the Koopman operator can be used to generate approximate linear, bilinear, and nonlinear model realizations from data, and argues in favor of bilinear realizations for characterizing systems with unknown dynamics. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a dynamical system to have a valid linear or bilinear realization over a given set of observable functions are presented and used to show that every control-affine system admits an infinite-dimensional bilinear realization, but does not necessarily admit a linear one. Therefore, approximate bilinear realizations constructed from generic sets of basis functions tend to improve as the number of basis functions increases, whereas approximate linear realizations may not. To demonstrate the advantages of bilinear Koopman realizations for control, a linear, bilinear, and nonlinear Koopman model realization of a simulated robot arm is constructed from data. In a trajectory following task, the bilinear realization exceeds the prediction accuracy of the linear realization and the computational efficiency of the nonlinear realization when incorporated into a model predictive control framework.},

However, maximal-coordinate approaches have several advantages over minimal-coordinate parameterizations, including native handling of closed kinematic loops and nonholonomic constraints. This paper describes a linear-time variational integrator that is formulated in maximal coordinates. Due to its variational formulation, the algorithm does not suffer from constraint drift and has favorable energy and momentum conservation properties. A sparse matrix factorization technique allows the dynamics of a loop-free articulated mechanism with n links to be computed in O(n) (linear) time. Additional constraints that introduce loops can also be handled by the algorithm without incurring much computational overhead. Experimental results show that our approach offers speed competitive with state-of-the-art minimal-coordinate algorithms while outperforming them in several scenarios, especially when dealing with closed loops and configuration singularities.},

Typically, LQR is implemented in minimal coordinates (also called generalized or ``joint'' coordinates). However, other coordinates are possible and recent research suggests that there may be numerical and control-theoretic advantages when using higher-dimensional non-minimal state parameterizations for dynamical systems. One such parameterization is maximal coordinates, in which each link in a multi-body system is parameterized by its full six degrees of freedom and joints between links are modeled with algebraic constraints. Such constraints can also represent closed kinematic loops or contact with the environment. This paper investigates the difference between minimal- and maximal-coordinate LQR control laws. A case study of applying LQR to a simple pendulum and simulations comparing the basins of attraction of minimal- and maximal-coordinate LQR controllers suggest that maximal-coordinate LQR achieves greater robustness and improved performance compared to minimal-coordinate LQR when applied to nonlinear systems.}

  abstract = {This paper derives an IMU-GPS-fused inertial navigation observer for a mobile robot using the theory of invariant observer design. One of the main features of invariant observers for invariant systems on Lie groups is that the estimation error is autonomous, hence the observable state variables can be rendered convergent within a domain of attraction that is independent of the system's trajectory. The Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (In-EKF) which is an extension of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is supposed to be more efficient given that the system converges to constant values on a larger set of trajectories as opposed to the equilibrium points that an EKF is based on. This paper explores the implementation of the In-EKF for robot localization and is compared against an implementation of the EKF. The localization is performed on the University of Michigan north campus long-term vision and LIDAR dataset.}

The method is based on the Koopman operator approach to nonlinear dynamical systems analysis, which models the flow of observables in a function space, rather than a flow in a state space. Practically, this method estimates a nonlinear diffeomorphism that lifts the dynamics to a higher dimensional space where they are linear. Efficient Model Predictive Control methods can then be applied to the lifted model. This approach allows for real time implementation in on-board hardware, with rigorous incorporation of both input and state constraints during learning. We demonstrate the method in a real-time implementation of fast multirotor landing, where the nonlinear ground effect is learned and used to improve landing speed and quality.}

Koopman-based model learning methods can capture these nonlinear dynamical system effects in higher dimensional lifted bilinear models that are amenable to optimal control. However, standard methods that lift the system state using a fixed function dictionary before model learning result in high dimensional models that are intractable for real time control. This paper presents a novel method that jointly learns a function dictionary and lifted bilinear model purely from data by incorporating the Koopman model in a neural network architecture. Nonlinear MPC design utilizing the learned model can be performed readily. We experimentally realized this method on a multirotor drone for agile trajectory tracking at low altitudes where the aerodynamic ground effect influences the system's behavior. Experimental results demonstrate that the learning-based controller achieves similar performance as a nonlinear MPC based on a nominal dynamics model in medium altitude. However, our learning-based system can reliably track trajectories in near-ground flight regimes while the nominal controller crashes due to unmodeled dynamical effects that are captured by our method.},

We show that our MPC actor is an importance sampler, which minimizes an upper bound of the cross-entropy to the state distribution of the optimal sampling policy. In our experiments with a Ballbot system, we show that our algorithm can work with sparse and binary reward signals to efficiently solve obstacle avoidance and target reaching tasks. Compared to previous work, we show that including the value function in the running cost of the trajectory optimizer speeds up the convergence. We also discuss the necessary strategies to robustify the algorithm in practice.},

  abstract = {We present a differentiable rigid-body-dynamics simulator for robotics that prioritizes physical accuracy and differentiability: Dojo. The simulator utilizes an expressive maximal-coordinates representation, achieves stable simulation at low sample rates, and conserves energy and momentum by employing a variational integrator. A nonlinear complementarity problem, with nonlinear friction cones, models hard contact and is reliably solved using a custom primal-dual interior-point method. The implicit-function theorem enables efficient differentiation of an intermediate relaxed problem and computes smooth gradients from the contact model. We demonstrate the usefulness of the simulator and its gradients through a number of examples including: simulation, trajectory optimization, reinforcement learning, and system identification.}

However, successful application of MPC depends critically on the performance of the algorithms used to solve the underlying optimization problems. An ideal solver should both leverage the structure of the MPC problem and support efficient "warm starting" so that information from previous solutions can be recycled to speed convergence. We present ALTRO-C, a high-performance solver with both of these properties that utilizes an augmented Lagrangian method to handle general convex conic constraints.

In practice, however, it often requires an expert to craft and tune this cost function and find trade-offs between different state penalties to satisfy simple high level objectives. In this paper, we use Reinforcement Learning and in particular value learning to approximate the value function given only high level objectives , which can be sparse and binary. Building upon previous works, we present improvements that allowed us to successfully deploy the method on a real world unmanned ground vehicle. Our experiments show that our method can learn the cost function from scratch and without human intervention , while reaching a performance level similar to that of an expert-tuned MPC. We perform a quantitative comparison of these methods with standard MPC approaches both in simulation and on the real robot.

  abstract = {This paper presents a class of linear predictors for nonlinear controlled dynamical systems. The basic idea is to lift (or embed) the nonlinear dynamics into a higher dimensional space where its evolution is approximately linear. In an uncontrolled setting, this procedure amounts to numerical approximations of the Koopman operator associated to the nonlinear dynamics. In this work, we extend the Koopman operator to controlled dynamical systems and apply the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) to compute a finite-dimensional approximation of the operator in such a way that this approximation has the form of a linear controlled dynamical system. In numerical examples, the linear predictors obtained in this way exhibit a performance superior to existing linear predictors such as those based on local linearization or the so called Carleman linearization. Importantly, the procedure to construct these linear predictors is completely data-driven and extremely simple-it boils down to a nonlinear transformation of the data (the lifting) and a linear least squares problem in the lifted space that can be readily solved for large data sets. These linear predictors can be readily used to design controllers for the nonlinear dynamical system using linear controller design methodologies. We focus in particular on model predictive control (MPC) and show that MPC controllers designed in this way enjoy computational complexity of the underlying optimization problem comparable to that of MPC for a linear dynamical system with the same number of control inputs and the same dimension of the state-space. Importantly, linear inequality constraints on the state and control inputs as well as nonlinear constraints on the state can be imposed in a linear fashion in the proposed MPC scheme. Similarly, cost functions nonlinear in the state variable can be handled in a linear fashion. We treat both the full-state measurement case and the input-output case, as well as systems with disturbances/noise. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach. 1},

Traditional model-based locomotion controllers require simplifying assumptions and careful modelling; any small errors can result in unstable control. To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control. We demonstrate this on versatile walking behaviors such as tracking a target walking velocity, walking height, and turning yaw. (Video).}

To achieve this, we integrate Koopman operator theory with Lyapunov-based model predictive control (LMPC). The main idea is to transform nonlinear dynamics from state-space to function space using Koopman eigenfunctions-for control affine systems this results in a bilinear model in the (lifted) function space. Then, a predictive controller is formulated in Koopman eigenfunction coordinates which uses an auxiliary Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) based bounded controller as a constraint to ensure stability of the Koopman system in the function space. Provided there exists a continuously differentiable inverse mapping between the original state-space and (lifted) function space, we show that the designed controller is capable of translating the feedback stabiliz-ability of the Koopman bilinear system to the original nonlinear system. Remarkably, the feedback control design proposed in this work remains completely data-driven and does not require any explicit knowledge of the original system. Furthermore, due to the bilinear structure of the Koopman model, seeking a CLF is no longer a bottleneck for LMPC. Benchmark numerical examples demonstrate the utility of the proposed feedback control design.},

They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical al- gorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed- form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpreta- tions of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

In order to preserve the relatively low data requirements for an approximation via dynamic mode decomposition, a quantization approach was recently proposed in [S. Peitz and S. Klus, Automatica J. IFAC, 106 (2019), pp. 184- 191]. This way, control of nonlinear dynamical systems can be realized by means of switched systems techniques, using only a finite set of autonomous Koopman operator-based reduced models. These individual systems can be approximated very efficiently from data. The main idea is to transform a control system into a set of autonomous systems for which the optimal switching sequence has to be computed. In this article, we extend these results to continuous control inputs using relaxation. This way, we combine the advantages of the data efficiency of approximating a finite set of autonomous systems with continuous controls, as the data requirements increase only linearly with the input dimension. We show that when using the Koopman generator, this relaxation-realized by linear interpolation between two operators-does not introduce any error for control affine systems. This allows us to control high-dimensional nonlinear systems using bilinear, low-dimensional surrogate models. The efficiency of the proposed approach is demonstrated using several examples with increasing complexity, from the Duffing oscillator to the chaotic fluidic pinball.},

For actuated systems, standard Koopman analysis and DMD are incapable of producing input-output models; moreover, the dynamics and the modes will be corrupted by external forcing. Our new theoretical developments extend Koopman operator theory to allow for systems with nonlinear input-output characteristics. We show how this generalization is rigorously connected to a recent development called dynamic mode decomposition with control. We demonstrate this new theory on nonlinear dynamical systems, including a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered model with relevance to the analysis of infectious disease data with mass vaccination (actuation).},

In these scenarios, coordinating the planning of the vehicle's path and speed gives the vehicle the best chance of avoiding an obstacle. Fast reaction time is also important in an emergency, but approaches to the trajectory planning problem based on nonlinear optimization are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new scheme that simultaneously modifies the desired path and speed profile for a vehicle in response to the appearance of an obstacle, significant tracking error, or other environmental change. By formulating the trajectory optimization problem as a quadratically constrained quadratic program, solution times of less than 20 ms are possible even with a 10-s planning horizon. A simplified point mass model is used to describe the vehicle's motion, but the incorporation of longitudinal weight transfer and road topography means that the vehicle's acceleration limits are modeled more accurately than in comparable approaches. Experimental data from an autonomous vehicle in two scenarios demonstrate how the trajectory planner enables the vehicle to avoid an obstacle even when the obstacle appears suddenly and the vehicle is already operating near the friction limits.},

Thus, we take the approach of reasoning directly in the space of images, and acquire the dynamics of visual measurements in order to synthesize a visual-feedback policy. We present a simple controller using an image-space Lyapunov function, and evaluate the closed-loop performance using three different class of models for image prediction: deep-learning-based models for image-to-image translation, an object-centric model obtained from treating each pixel as a particle, and a switched-linear system where an action-dependent linear map is used. Through results in simulation and experiment, we show that for this task, a linear model works surprisingly well -- achieving better prediction error, downstream task performance, and generalization to new environments than the deep models we trained on the same amount of data. We believe these results provide an interesting example in the spectrum of models that are most useful for vision-based feedback in manipulation, considering both the quality of visual prediction, as well as compatibility with rigorous methods for control design and analysis.

  abstract = {The Koopman operator is a linear but infinite-dimensional operator that governs the evolution of scalar observables defined on the state space of an autonomous dynamical system and is a powerful tool for the analysis and decomposition of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this manuscript, we present a data-driven method for approximating the leading eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and modes of the Koopman operator. The method requires a data set of snapshot pairs and a dictionary of scalar observables, but does not require explicit governing equations or interaction with a ``black box'' integrator. We will show that this approach is, in effect, an extension of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which has been used to approximate the Koopman eigenvalues and modes. Furthermore, if the data provided to the method are generated by a Markov process instead of a deterministic dynamical system, the algorithm approximates the eigenfunctions of the Kolmogorov backward equation, which could be considered as the ``stochastic Koopman operator'' (Mezic in Nonlinear Dynamics 41(1\textendash 3): 309\textendash 325,~2005). Finally, four illustrative examples are presented: two that highlight the quantitative performance of the method when presented with either deterministic or stochastic data and two that show potential applications of the Koopman eigenfunctions.},

  abstract = {The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a common optimization tool for solving constrained and non-differentiable problems. We provide an empirical study of the practical performance of ADMM on several nonconvex applications, including 0 regularized linear regression, 0 regularized image de-noising, phase retrieval, and eigenvector computation. Our experiments suggest that ADMM performs well on a broad class of non-convex problems. Moreover, recently proposed adaptive ADMM methods, which automatically tune penalty parameters as the method runs, can improve algorithm efficiency and solution quality compared to ADMM with a non-tuned penalty.}

However, its performance is highly sensitive to a penalty parameter, making ADMM often unreliable and hard to automate for a non-expert user. We tackle this weakness of ADMM by proposing a method that adaptively tunes the penalty parameter to achieve fast convergence. The resulting adaptive ADMM (AADMM) algorithm, inspired by the successful Barzilai-Borwein spectral method for gradient descent, yields fast convergence and relative insensitivity to the initial stepsize and problem scaling.}
